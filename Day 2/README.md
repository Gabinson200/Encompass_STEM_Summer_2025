### Day 2: Electrical and Computer Theory, Ohm's Law, Transistors, Boolean Algebra, Logic Gates, Computers vs. Microprocessors
**Learning Objectives:**
- Understand fundamental electrical concepts and Ohm's Law.
- Learn about the basic function of transistors.
- Grasp the principles of Boolean algebra and logic gates.
- Differentiate between general-purpose computers and microprocessors.
- Understand the difference between digital and analog signals and their applications in electronics.

**Activities:**
- **Review of Day 1 & Q&A (15 minutes):**
  - Quick recap of robotics history and mathematical foundations.
  - Address any questions from Day 1.

- **Basic Electrical Concepts and Ohm's Law (60 minutes):**
  - Voltage (V): Electrical potential difference (pressure).
  - Current (I): Flow of electrons (rate of flow).
  - Resistance (R): Opposition to current flow.
  - Ohm's Law (V=IR): Explain the relationship between V, I, and R.
  - Series and Parallel Circuits: Basic concepts and calculations.
  - Hands-on Demonstration: Use a multimeter to measure voltage, current, and resistance in simple circuits built on a breadboard if available, otherwise use online simulation.

- **Introduction to Transistors (45 minutes):**
  - What is a transistor? (Basic function as a switch or amplifier).
  - Brief overview of NPN/PNP transistors (conceptual, no deep dive into physics).
  - How transistors are used in digital electronics (e.g., as building blocks for logic gates).

- **Boolean Algebra and Logic Gates (60 minutes):**
  - Boolean Algebra: Introduction to binary logic (True/False, 1/0).
  - Basic Logic Gates: AND, OR, NOT, XOR, NAND, NOR.
  - Truth tables for each gate.
  - Simulate simple logic gates using online tools.

- **Digital vs. Analog Signals (30 minutes):**
  - Define digital and analog signals.
  - Show examples of waveforms and discuss where each is used.
  - Explain the relevance to sensors, actuators, and real-world interfacing.
  - Demonstration or video comparison (e.g., analog microphone vs. digital button).

- **Computers vs. Microprocessors (30 minutes):**
  - General-Purpose Computers: Overview of components (CPU, RAM, storage, I/O).
  - Microprocessors: What they are and how they differ from full computers (integrated CPU, memory, I/O on a single chip).
  - Role of microprocessors in embedded systems and robotics.
